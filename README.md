Terraform Website Hosting Configuration
This repository contains a Terraform configuration for setting up a sample website hosting environment using AWS services. It demonstrates the use of 
Terraform to automate the provisioning of web hosting infrastructure, including an S3 bucket for static website hosting and any additional required resources.

Project Overview
This project includes a Terraform setup to deploy a static website on AWS. It automates the process of creating and configuring the necessary AWS resources to host a website, making it easy to deploy and manage web applications with minimal manual intervention. 
Features
Static Website Hosting: Utilizes AWS S3 to host a static website with public access.
Infrastructure Automation: Automates the setup of web hosting infrastructure using Terraform.
Domain Management: Configures DNS settings if needed (can be integrated with Route 53 or other DNS providers).
Version Control: Maintains infrastructure as code, allowing easy updates and versioning.
Key Components
S3 Bucket: Hosts static website files with public access.
IAM Policies: Configures necessary permissions for managing and accessing the S3 bucket.
CloudFront (Optional): Provides content delivery network (CDN) services for faster content delivery (if included in the configuration).
Route 53 (Optional): Manages domain name registration and DNS settings (if applicable).
Getting Started
To deploy your static website using this Terraform configuration:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-website-hosting.git
cd terraform-website-hosting
Install Terraform: Ensure Terraform is installed on your machine. Download it from the Terraform website.

Configure Your Variables: Edit the terraform.tfvars file or create a new file to specify your configuration settings, such as the bucket name and region. Example:

hcl
Copy code
bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
region       = "us-west-2"
Initialize Terraform: Initialize the Terraform working directory:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan and Apply the Configuration: Create an execution plan and apply it to provision the resources:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
Review the changes and confirm to proceed.

Deploy Website Files: Upload your website files to the S3 bucket created by Terraform.

Verify Deployment: Access your website using the S3 bucket URL or configured domain.

Example Configuration
S3 Bucket Name: example-bucket-name
Region: us-west-2
